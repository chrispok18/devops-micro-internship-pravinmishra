# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will learn how Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts provide persistent storage for containers, deploying applications that retain logs and data even after containers are stopped or removed.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application with Persistent Logs Using Bind Mounts

## Goal

Run an Nginx container (`myweb`) with a Bind Mount from `~/nginx-logs` to `/var/log/nginx`, verify the site loads, confirm logs are written, remove the container, and confirm the logs persist on the host.

# Task 2 — Deploy Two Containers with Persistent Data Using Docker Volumes

## Goal

Create a custom network `mynetwork` and a Docker volume `shared-data`, build and run a `backend` container that writes to the shared volume and a `frontend` container that reads from it, and confirm updates are reflected immediately.
